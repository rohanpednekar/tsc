### Discussion Items

* Chunxu shared the presto router design:
  * Backgound:
    * Deployment in Twitter for 2 years.
    * At Twitter traditionally large clusters are allocated independently could result in unbalance resource usage. 
    * User also needs to know each clusters' endpoint for usage. 
    * The presto router is designed to introduce a layout between user and all the physical clusters.
  * Designï¼š
    * Presto router will be responsible to send a query to a specific cluster by workload balancing mechanism using round-robin hash or random choice. 
    * Clusters may be logically grouped, so router can decide query to run on which group of cluster per query pattern.
    * In addition, Twitter engineers develops query predictor which is contributed to presto oss via a different repo
      * Purpose of the query predictor is to forecast resource usage of some incoming SQL queries. 
      * This is the estimated results usage for presto router which enables a more intelligent way of scheduling query across the clusters.
      * Presto router also periodically collects statistics from all the clusters.
    * This feature also comes with a Router UI which is a unified UI of all the clusters with some aggregated stats of current status of all the presto clusters.
* Presto Conformance program updates by Rohan
  * Categorizes a set of features that defines what makes presto the "presto"
  * Looking for volunteers/contributors to join the conformance work group to build the conformance test cases. Reach out to Rohan and/or Tim if interested
